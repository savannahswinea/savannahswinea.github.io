- I designed a project with my thesis mentor where we sought to understand the economic impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. This study was a point of convergence to understand ecological responses of fish stocks, fisheries economics in a post-disaster landscape, and the social implications for Gulf coast fishermen and communities. I am proud that this study resulted in my first first-author publication in the journal Ecosphere. This formative experience was instrumental in solidifying my desire to work at the nexus of environment and society in graduate school.
