It is an utmost priority for me to advance DEIJ as both a survival strategy and a way to foster sense of belonging for myself and others. People with underrepresented identities have been marginalized in STEM spaces, and because we contribute unique outlooks on research, this has been to the detriment of the field. I attack this problem holistically: through highlighting diverse knowledge in my research; through fostering an inclusive climate in my teaching; and through supporting DEI work within my university and professional extracurriculars.

## You Are Welcome Here Campaign

As a PhD Student at Northeastern University, I helped to coordinate a “You Are Welcome Here” campaign with the aim to increase the visibility and acceptance of LGBTQ+ students in my department. We distributed stickers and signs for our community to display, and also hosted annual workshops designed to familiarize participants with vocabulary, highlight research from LGBTQ+ scientists, and immerse participants in real-life scenarios.

## Rising TIDES

In 2017, the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) established [Rising TIDES](https://www.cerf.science/rising-tides-program), a NSF-funded program to support students from backgrounds underrepresented in coastal and estuarine sciences to pursue careers in those fields. I received an award through the Rising TIDES Program in 2021 to attend two professional conferences, speak on a panel, and participate in multiple career training workshops. This program was a crucial pathway for me to meet scientists at various career stages who have succeeded despite societal hurdles. In 2023, I was invited back to Rising TIDES in an advisory role, which involved providing technical and logistical support during planning, workshops, and conference proceedings. As a former student member, I was grateful to have the opportunity to engage with the next cohort of Rising TIDES students.
