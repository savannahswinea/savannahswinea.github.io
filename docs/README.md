# Knowledge co-production for sustainability
[About](https://shswinea.github.io/) | [Research](/research.md) | [Teaching](/teaching.md)

Welcome!

My research focuses on co-producing knowledge with scientists and local experts and applying that knowledge to practically benefit ecosystems and societies. My work is interdisciplinary, spanning environmental and social sciences, and I use participatory approaches alongside statistical and computational methods to unpack complex modern challenges.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at North Carolina State University in partnership the United States Geological Survey (USGS) [Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center](https://secasc.ncsu.edu/).

I received my BS in Environmental Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and my PhD in Marine and Environmental Sciences at Northeastern University.
